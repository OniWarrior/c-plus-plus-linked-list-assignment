# c-plus-plus-linked-list-assignment--Singly Linked List portion of assignment.
This is a homework assignment dealing with a singly linked list and doubly linked list for swapping reference

Note: This only covers the singly linked list. The codebase grew and it would be inconvenient to cover the doubly linked
list here. I'll create a separate repo for the doubly linked list.
